# Creating an interactive dashboard for survey data
_Exported on 7/18/2025 at 06:34:37 PDT from Cursor (1.2.4)_

**User**

@/SurveySummaryDash  is a github repository for animal sounds from survey data and I want to view the data by creating an interactive dashboard for Github Pages. The data includes the detection data saved as csv files, where the name of the csv file includes the projectName_species.csv).  If there are more than one data files, then the user will select the data (drop-down menu). All of the columns in those data files will be user choices for the visualizations. The dashboard will include a summary at the top and user defined visualiztions below the summary. The summary will be a subtitle of the Project and Species, and then a text summary (from a text file in the supplement folder with the projectName_species.txt format). To the right of the text summary will be a map that is sized to include all of the Latitude and Longitude points for the selected data, and include dots for each detection (row). If multiple species (species column), then they will be identified by color).  Below this top row will be a choice of visualizations to display from a left sidebar that can be hidden. Additional options will be added over time, but to start I want to have (1) plotDetectionBoxPlot from the pamscapes package on cran for each selected species and callType, (2) plotPolarDetections from pamscapes package on cran for each species and callType.

Great project idea! Here’s a plan to create an interactive dashboard for your animal sound survey data, suitable for GitHub Pages. I’ll outline the architecture, tech stack, and the first implementation steps, focusing on your requirements:

---

## **Tech Stack Recommendation**

- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast builds)
- **Visualization:** [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) or [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for custom plots, [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for maps
- **CSV Parsing:** [PapaParse](https://www.papaparse.com/) (browser-based CSV parsing)
- **UI Components:** [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) or [Material-UI](https://mui.com/)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (static site)

> **Note:** The `pamscapes` package is R-based. For a JS dashboard, we’ll need to **recreate similar plots in JS**. If you want to run R code, you’d need a backend or pre-generate plots.

---

## **Dashboard Layout**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Dropdown: Select Data File] --> B[Summary Row]
    B --> C[Text Summary (from .txt)]
    B --> D[Map (Leaflet)]
    B --> E[Sidebar: Visualization Choices]
    E --> F[Box Plot (per species/callType)]
    E --> G[Polar Plot (per species/callType)]
```

---

## **Step-by-Step Implementation Plan**

### 1. **Project Setup**
- Initialize a React project (Vite or Create React App).
- Add dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, `papaparse`, `react-leaflet`, `plotly.js`, and a UI library.

### 2. **Data File Selection**
- On load, scan the `/data` directory for `*.csv` files.
- Populate a dropdown with available files.

### 3. **Summary Row**
- When a file is selected:
  - Parse the CSV.
  - Extract project and species from the filename.
  - Load the corresponding summary text from `/supplement/{projectName_species}.txt`.
  - Display the summary and a map.

### 4. **Map Visualization**
- Use `react-leaflet` to plot all detection points.
- Color dots by species (if multiple).
- Auto-zoom to fit all points.

### 5. **Sidebar & Visualizations**
- Sidebar lists available visualizations (Box Plot, Polar Plot).
- User selects which to display.
- For each, allow selection of columns (species, callType, etc.).
- Render plots using Plotly.js.

### 6. **Extensibility**
- Design the sidebar to easily add new visualization options.

---

## **Next Steps**

Would you like to:
1. **Start with a project scaffold** (React + dependencies)?
2. **See a sample component** (e.g., file dropdown + summary + map)?
3. **Discuss how to mimic pamscapes plots in JS?**

Let me know your preference, and I’ll generate the code and setup instructions!

```plaintext
graph TD
    A[Dropdown: Select Data File] --> B[Summary Row]
    B --> C[Text Summary (from .txt)]
    B --> D[Map (Leaflet)]
    B --> E[Sidebar: Visualization Choices]
    E --> F[Box Plot (per species/callType)]
    E --> G[Polar Plot (per species/callType)]
```

**User**

I should add that I need all of this build using open source methods. If this is the case, then please start to build the project

---

**Cursor**

It looks like Node.js and npm are not currently installed or not available in your system's PATH, which are required to set up a React project using Vite and to use open source JavaScript libraries.

**Next steps:**
1. **Install Node.js** (which includes npm) from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. After installation, restart your terminal and let me know when you're ready, or I can check again for you.

Once Node.js is installed, I’ll proceed with initializing the project and setting up the open source dashboard as planned!

Node.js and npm are not currently installed or not available in your system's PATH. These are required to build the open source React dashboard.

**To proceed:**
1. **Download and install Node.js** from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm.
2. **Restart your terminal** after installation to ensure npm is available in your PATH.

Once you’ve installed Node.js and npm, let me know (or just say "ready"), and I’ll continue with setting up your dashboard project!

---

**User**

Node.js is installed. How do I install npm?

---

**Cursor**

Great news: **npm is included automatically when you install Node.js**. You do not need to install npm separately.

To verify that both are installed and available in your terminal, run these commands:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers for both. If you do, you’re ready to proceed with the dashboard setup! If you get an error, let me know what it says and I’ll help troubleshoot.

```shellscript
node -v
npm -v
```

This error is due to Windows PowerShell’s execution policy, which by default restricts running scripts like `npm.ps1`. This is a common issue and can be fixed safely.

### **How to Fix: Enable PowerShell Scripts for npm**

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - Click Start, type `powershell`, right-click on Windows PowerShell, and select **Run as administrator**.

2. **Set the Execution Policy:**
   - Run this command to allow local scripts (including npm) to run:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```
   - When prompted, type `Y` and press Enter.

3. **Close and reopen your terminal** (or VS Code/PowerShell window).

4. **Try again:**
   ```powershell
   npm -v
   ```

You should now see the npm version number.  
Let me know when this works, and I’ll proceed with the dashboard setup!

```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

```powershell
   npm -v
```

This works now, please continue

Is something wrong? This is taking a long time?

It looks like the project creation process was waiting for user input (such as the package name) and may have stalled or been interrupted. This can happen if the process expects interactive input and doesn't receive it, or if the terminal session was closed or interrupted.

**What to do:**

1. **Try again with non-interactive flags:**  
   We can specify all required options in the command to avoid prompts. Here’s a command you can run to create the project non-interactively:

   ```sh
   npm create vite@latest SurveySummaryDashDashboard -- --template react --name SurveySummaryDashDashboard --yes
   ```

2. **If you see prompts:**  
   - For "Package name", just press Enter to accept the default, or type `surveysummarydashdashboard`.
   - For other prompts, you can accept defaults by pressing Enter.

3. **If the process hangs again:**  
   - Cancel with `Ctrl+C`.
   - Let me know, and I can guide you through a manual setup or alternative method.

Would you like me to try running the non-interactive command for you, or would you prefer to run it yourself and let me know when it’s done?

```shellscript
   npm create vite@latest SurveySummaryDashDashboard -- --template react --name SurveySummaryDashDashboard --yes
```

---

**User**

seems to be stuck on this: 

---

**Cursor**

The process is waiting for you to enter a package name. You can simply press **Enter** to accept the default (`surveysummarydashdashboard`), or type a name you prefer and then press Enter.

**If it continues to prompt for more options:**
- For any other questions, you can usually just press Enter to accept the defaults.

**If it still hangs after pressing Enter:**
- Cancel with `Ctrl+C`.
- Let me know, and I can guide you through a fully non-interactive setup or help troubleshoot further.

Would you like to try pressing Enter now, or should I provide a step-by-step for a non-interactive setup?

---

**User**

I would like to change the project name to SurveySummaryDash but I am not sure where to enter this information (I am new to all of this)

---

**Cursor**

No problem! Here’s how you can set the project name to `SurveySummaryDash` during the Vite setup:

### When Prompted:
When you see:
```
◆  Package name:
│  surveysummarydashdashboard
```
Just **type**:
```
SurveySummaryDash
```
and then **press Enter**.

This will set your project’s name to `SurveySummaryDash`.

---

### What Happens Next?
- You may get a few more prompts (like “TypeScript?” or “Install dependencies?”). For most, you can just press Enter to accept the defaults.
- When the process finishes, you’ll have a new folder called `SurveySummaryDash` in your current directory.

---

**If you get stuck or see another prompt you’re unsure about, just copy it here and I’ll guide you through it!**

```plaintext
◆  Package name:
│  surveysummarydashdashboard
```

```plaintext
SurveySummaryDash
```

NPM package names must be all lowercase and cannot contain uppercase letters or certain special characters. That’s why `surveySummaryDash` (with uppercase letters) is being rejected.

**What to do:**
- Enter the name in all lowercase and with hyphens or no spaces, like:
  ```
  surveysummarydash
  ```
  or
  ```
  survey-summary-dash
  ```

**Summary:**  
Just type `surveysummarydash` (all lowercase, no spaces or uppercase letters) and press Enter.  
This will allow the setup to continue!

```plaintext
  surveysummarydash
```

```plaintext
  survey-summary-dash
```

**User**

what framework should I add?

---

**Cursor**

For your project, you should select **React** as the framework.

When prompted with something like:
```
Select a framework:
> Vanilla
  Vue
  React
  Preact
  Svelte
  Solid
  Qwik
  Lit
```
Use the arrow keys to highlight **React** and press **Enter**.

If you are prompted for a variant (like TypeScript or JavaScript), you can choose:
- **JavaScript** (easier for beginners)
- Or **TypeScript** (if you want type safety, but it’s optional)

**Summary:**  
- **Framework:** React  
- **Variant:** JavaScript (unless you want to use TypeScript)

Let me know if you see any other prompts!

```plaintext
Select a framework:

Great job! Your React (Vite) development server is running. Here’s what you can do next:

### 1. **View Your App**
- Open your web browser.
- Go to: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
- You should see the default Vite + React welcome page.

### 2. **Next Steps for Your Dashboard**
Now you’re ready to start building your interactive dashboard! Here’s what we’ll do next:
1. **Install required libraries** for CSV parsing, mapping, and plotting.
2. **Set up the project structure** for your dashboard.
3. **Begin coding the dashboard features** (file dropdown, summary, map, sidebar, plots).

Would you like me to:
- Install the required libraries for you?
- Or would you like a list of commands to run yourself?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

---

**User**

Please install required libraries, and then create code for dashboard features

---

**Cursor**

The required libraries are installed and your project is ready for development!

### **Next Steps: Dashboard Feature Implementation**

Here’s what I’ll do next:
1. **Replace the default App.jsx** with a scaffold for your dashboard, including:
   - File dropdown (for CSV selection)
   - Summary row (project/species subtitle, text summary, map)
   - Sidebar for visualization choices
   - Placeholder for visualizations

2. **Add comments and structure** so you can easily expand features.

**Note:**  
For the dashboard to access your CSV and summary text files, you’ll need to copy them into the `public/data` and `public/supplement` folders of your new React project. I’ll include instructions in the code comments.

I’ll now update `App.jsx` to scaffold the dashboard UI and logic.

      },
    });
    // Load summary text
    const [project, species] = selectedFile.replace('.csv', '').split('_');
    fetch(process.env.PUBLIC_URL + `/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`)
      .then((res) => res.text())
      .then(setSummaryText)
      .catch(() => setSummaryText('No summary available.'));
  }, [selectedFile]);

  // Extract lat/lon for map
  const latCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('lat'));
  const lonCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('lon'));
  const points = csvData.filter(row => row[latCol] && row[lonCol]);

  // Map center (mean of points)
  const mapCenter = points.length
    ? [
        points.reduce((sum, r) => sum + parseFloat(r[latCol]), 0) / points.length,

export default App;

```

Your dashboard scaffold is now in place! Here’s what’s included and what you should do next:

---

### **What’s Implemented**
- **File Dropdown:** Selects which CSV data file to view.
- **Summary Row:** Shows project/species subtitle, loads summary text, and displays a map of detections.
- **Sidebar:** Lets you choose between “Detection Box Plot” and “Polar Detections” (placeholders for now).
- **Map:** Plots detection points from the CSV, auto-centers, and shows popups with row details.
- **Instructions:** Tells you where to place your data and summary files (`public/data/` and `public/supplement/`).

---

### **What You Should Do Next**
1. **Copy your CSV and summary text files** into:
   - `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/public/data/`
   - `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/public/supplement/`
2. **Restart the dev server** if it’s not running:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)** to see your dashboard in action.

---

### **Next Steps**
- Would you like me to implement the actual box plot and polar plot visualizations next?
- Or do you want to test the current setup with your data first?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

---

**User**

I moved the files, but I am having problems restarting the dev server (it is blank when I open).

---

**Cursor**

Let's troubleshoot the blank page issue step by step:

### 1. **Restart the Dev Server**
Make sure you are in the `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` directory, then run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
If you see a message like `VITE v7.0.4  ready in ...`, open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

---

### 2. **Check the Browser Console**
If the page is still blank:
- Open your browser’s **Developer Tools** (usually F12 or right-click → Inspect).
- Go to the **Console** tab.
- Look for any red error messages and copy them here.

---

### 3. **Common Issues**
- **File Paths:** Make sure your CSV and TXT files are in:
  - `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/public/data/`
  - `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/public/supplement/`
- **File Names:** The dropdown in the dashboard expects files like `ADRIFT_All.csv`. If your file names are different, update the `DATA_FILES` array in `App.jsx` to match your actual file names.

---

### 4. **If You See Errors in the Terminal**
Copy any error messages from the terminal here so I can help diagnose.

---

**Please let me know:**
- What you see in the browser console (any errors?).
- If there are any errors in the terminal after running `npm run dev`.
- The exact names of the files you placed in the `public/data` and `public/supplement` folders.

This will help me quickly pinpoint the issue and get your dashboard running!

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

**User**

Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
    App App.jsx:27
    React 20
    performWorkUntilDeadline scheduler.development.js:45

---

**Cursor**

This error occurs because `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` is not defined in Vite (it’s a Create React App convention, not Vite). In Vite, you should use relative paths directly from the `public` folder.

### **How to Fix**

**In your `App.jsx`, replace:**
```js
process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/data/' + selectedFile
```
**with:**
```js
'/data/' + selectedFile
```
And similarly, replace:
```js
process.env.PUBLIC_URL + `/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`
```
**with:**
```js
`/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`
```

---

### **Summary of What to Change**
- Remove all `process.env.PUBLIC_URL` references.
- Use paths like `/data/filename.csv` and `/supplement/filename.txt`.

---

Would you like me to make this change for you?

```javascript
process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/data/' + selectedFile
```

```javascript
'/data/' + selectedFile
```

```javascript
process.env.PUBLIC_URL + `/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`
```

```javascript
`/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`
```

---

**User**

Yes make these changes for me

---

**Cursor**

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!selectedFile) return;
    Papa.parse('/data/' + selectedFile, {
      header: true,
      download: true,
      complete: (results) => {
        setCsvData(results.data);
        setColumns(results.meta.fields || []);
      },
    });
    // Load summary text
    const [project, species] = selectedFile.replace('.csv', '').split('_');
    fetch(`/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`)
      .then((res) => res.text())
      .then(setSummaryText)
      .catch(() => setSummaryText('No summary available.'));
  }, [selectedFile]);
// ... existing code ...
```

The code has been updated to use Vite-compatible paths for your data and supplement files. This should resolve the "process is not defined" error.

### What to do next:
1. **Restart your dev server** (if it’s not already running):
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Refresh your browser** at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

If you still see a blank page or any new errors, please let me know what appears in the browser console or terminal. Otherwise, you should now see your dashboard UI!

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

**User**

Ok, the react project with vite is now set up and we are ready for the next steps

---

**Cursor**

Fantastic! Your dashboard scaffold is running and ready for feature development.

### **Next Steps: Implement Visualizations**

Here’s what I’ll do next:
1. **Implement the Detection Box Plot** (using Plotly.js) for each selected species and callType.
2. **Implement the Polar Detections plot** (using Plotly.js) for each selected species and callType.
3. **Add dropdowns for user selection of species and callType** (if multiple exist in the data).

Let’s start by:
- Adding logic to detect available species and callTypes from the loaded CSV.
- Allowing the user to select which species and callType to visualize.
- Implementing the box plot and polar plot visualizations.

I’ll update the dashboard to include these features.

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...
  // Detect species and callType columns
  const speciesCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('species'));
  const callTypeCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('calltype'));
  const numericCols = columns.filter((c) => csvData.some(row => !isNaN(parseFloat(row[c]))));

  // Unique species and callTypes
  const speciesList = Array.from(new Set(csvData.map(row => row[speciesCol]).filter(Boolean)));
  const callTypeList = Array.from(new Set(csvData.map(row => row[callTypeCol]).filter(Boolean)));

  // User selections
  const [selectedSpecies, setSelectedSpecies] = useState('');
  const [selectedCallType, setSelectedCallType] = useState('');
  const [selectedValueCol, setSelectedValueCol] = useState('');

  // Update selections when data changes
  useEffect(() => {
    setSelectedSpecies(speciesList[0] || '');
    setSelectedCallType(callTypeList[0] || '');
    setSelectedValueCol(numericCols[0] || '');
  }, [speciesCol, callTypeCol, csvData.length]);

  // Filtered data for plots
  const filteredData = csvData.filter(row =>
    (!selectedSpecies || row[speciesCol] === selectedSpecies) &&
    (!selectedCallType || row[callTypeCol] === selectedCallType)
  );

  // Box Plot data
  const boxPlotData = [
    {
      y: filteredData.map(row => parseFloat(row[selectedValueCol])).filter(v => !isNaN(v)),
      type: 'box',
      name: `${selectedSpecies} - ${selectedCallType}`,
      boxpoints: 'all',
      jitter: 0.5,
      pointpos: 0,
    },
  ];

  // Polar Plot data (placeholder: use angle and radius columns if available)
  const angleCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('angle'));
  const radiusCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('radius'));
  const polarAngles = filteredData.map(row => parseFloat(row[angleCol])).filter(v => !isNaN(v));
  const polarRadii = filteredData.map(row => parseFloat(row[radiusCol])).filter(v => !isNaN(v));
  const polarPlotData = [
    {
      type: 'scatterpolar',
      r: polarRadii.length ? polarRadii : [1, 2, 3],
      theta: polarAngles.length ? polarAngles : [0, 120, 240],
      mode: 'markers',
      marker: { size: 8 },
      name: `${selectedSpecies} - ${selectedCallType}`,
    },
  ];
// ... existing code ...
        {/* Visualization Area */}
        <Box sx={{ mt: 4 }}>
          {/* Dropdowns for species, callType, and value column */}
          <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', gap: 2, mb: 2 }}>
            {speciesCol && (
              <Select
                value={selectedSpecies}
                onChange={e => setSelectedSpecies(e.target.value)}
                size="small"
                sx={{ minWidth: 120 }}
              >
                {speciesList.map(s => <MenuItem key={s} value={s}>{s}</MenuItem>)}
              </Select>
            )}
            {callTypeCol && (
              <Select
                value={selectedCallType}
                onChange={e => setSelectedCallType(e.target.value)}
                size="small"
                sx={{ minWidth: 120 }}
              >
                {callTypeList.map(c => <MenuItem key={c} value={c}>{c}</MenuItem>)}
              </Select>
            )}
            {selectedViz === 'boxplot' && (
              <Select
                value={selectedValueCol}
                onChange={e => setSelectedValueCol(e.target.value)}
                size="small"
                sx={{ minWidth: 120 }}
              >
                {numericCols.map(col => <MenuItem key={col} value={col}>{col}</MenuItem>)}
              </Select>
            )}
          </Box>
          {selectedViz === 'boxplot' && (
            <Plot
              data={boxPlotData}
              layout={{
                title: `Detection Box Plot for ${selectedSpecies} - ${selectedCallType}`,
                yaxis: { title: selectedValueCol },
                boxmode: 'group',
                height: 400,
              }}
              style={{ width: '100%' }}
            />
          )}
          {selectedViz === 'polar' && (
            <Plot
              data={polarPlotData}
              layout={{
                title: `Polar Detections for ${selectedSpecies} - ${selectedCallType}`,
                polar: { radialaxis: { visible: true } },
                height: 400,
              }}
              style={{ width: '100%' }}
            />
          )}
        </Box>
// ... existing code ...
```

The dashboard now includes:
- **Dropdowns for species, callType, and value column selection** (auto-detected from your CSV data).
- **Detection Box Plot**: Interactive box plot for the selected species, callType, and value column.
- **Polar Detections Plot**: Interactive polar plot using angle and radius columns (if available), or placeholder data.

### What to do next:
1. **Restart your dev server** if needed:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Refresh your browser** at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
3. **Try selecting different species, callTypes, and value columns** to see the plots update.

---

If you have any issues, or want to add more visualization types or features, let me know!

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

---

**User**

I do not see changes here?

---

**Cursor**

If you do not see the new dropdowns and plots, here are some possible reasons and steps to resolve:

---

### 1. **Check for Hot Reload**
- Sometimes, React’s hot reload doesn’t pick up all changes.
- **Try a full browser refresh** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R).
- If that doesn’t work, **stop the dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal), then run:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

---

### 2. **Check for Errors**
- Open your browser’s **Developer Console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console).
- Look for any red error messages and copy them here if you see any.

---

### 3. **Confirm the Code Update**
- Open `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/src/App.jsx` in your code editor.
- You should see code for:
  - `const speciesCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('species'));`
  - `<Select value={selectedSpecies} ...>` and similar dropdowns
  - `<Plot ... />` for the box plot and polar plot

If you do **not** see these in your file, the code update may not have been saved/applied.  
**Let me know if you want me to re-apply the code update, or if you want to copy-paste the code yourself.**

---

### 4. **Check Data Columns**
- The dropdowns and plots only appear if your CSV has columns with names containing `species`, `calltype`, and at least one numeric column.
- If your data uses different column names, let me know what they are so I can adjust the code.

---

**Let me know what you find in the above steps, and I’ll help you get the new features working!**

```shellscript
  npm run dev
```

**User**

Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `button`.

If you want to write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: button="true" or button={value.toString()}. react-dom_client.js:2473:33
Uncaught out of memory

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for sharing the error. Here’s what’s happening and how to fix it:

---

### 1. **Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `button`**
This is a warning from React. In the code, the `ListItem` component from MUI is being used like this:
```jsx
<ListItem button ...>
```
In recent versions of MUI, the `button` prop is deprecated or removed.  
**Fix:**  
Replace `button` with `component=\"button\"` or just remove the `button` prop and use `component=\"button\"` if you want it to behave like a button.

**Change this:**
```jsx
<ListItem button key={viz.key} ...>
```
**To this:**
```jsx
<ListItem component=\"button\" key={viz.key} ...>
```

---

### 2. **Uncaught out of memory**
This is a more serious error and may be caused by:
- Loading a very large CSV file.
- An infinite loop or runaway rendering in the code.

**What to do:**
- Make sure your CSV file is not extremely large (try with a smaller file if possible).
- After fixing the `ListItem` issue, see if the out-of-memory error persists.

---

### 3. **How to Apply the Fix**
Would you like me to update the code to fix the `ListItem` usage for you?  
If yes, I’ll make the change and you can try again.

---

**Let me know if you want me to apply the fix, and if your CSV is very large, try with a smaller sample to see if the dashboard loads.**

```javascriptreact
<ListItem button ...>
```

```javascriptreact
<ListItem button key={viz.key} ...>
```

```javascriptreact
<ListItem component=\"button\" key={viz.key} ...>
```

---

**User**

Update the code to fix ListIte and I have addressed the large csv

---

**Cursor**

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...
          <List>
            {visualizations.map((viz) => (
-              <ListItem button key={viz.key} selected={selectedViz === viz.key} onClick={() => setSelectedViz(viz.key)}>
+              <ListItem component="button" key={viz.key} selected={selectedViz === viz.key} onClick={() => setSelectedViz(viz.key)}>
                <ListItemText primary={viz.label} />
              </ListItem>
            ))}
          </List>
// ... existing code ...
```

The code has been updated to fix the MUI `ListItem` usage by replacing the deprecated `button` prop with `component="button"`. This should resolve the React warning.

### What to do next:
1. **Restart your dev server** (if it’s not already running):
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Refresh your browser** at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

If you see any new errors or issues, let me know. Otherwise, you should now see the dashboard with the sidebar, dropdowns, and visualizations working as expected!

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

---

**User**

Ok, so the framework is now available. What is next?

---

**Cursor**

Great! Now that your dashboard framework is working, here’s what you can do next to make it fully functional and ready for real use:

---

## 1. **Test with Your Real Data**
- Place your actual CSV files in `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/public/data/`
- Place your summary text files in `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/public/supplement/`
- Make sure the filenames match the expected format (e.g., `Project_Species.csv` and `Project_Species.txt`).

---

## 2. **Check Data Column Names**
- The dashboard auto-detects columns named like `species`, `calltype`, `lat`, `lon`, `angle`, `radius`.
- If your columns use different names, let me know! I can help you adjust the code to match your data.

---

## 3. **Try the Visualizations**
- Use the dropdowns to select different species, call types, and value columns.
- Check that the map, box plot, and polar plot update as expected.

---

## 4. **Polish and Customize**
- If you want to add more visualizations, filters, or summary statistics, let me know your ideas!
- If you want to improve the look and feel, I can help with UI tweaks.

---

## 5. **Prepare for GitHub Pages Deployment**
- When you’re ready to share your dashboard, I can guide you through building and deploying it to GitHub Pages so it’s accessible online.

---

### **Would you like to:**
- Add more features or visualizations?
- Adjust the dashboard for your specific data columns?
- Get instructions for deploying to GitHub Pages?
- Something else?

Let me know your next priority!

---

**User**

I changed the name of my files in the public/data and public/supplement (but still kept the same naming format), but now these are not updated in the page. it is showing html code in place of the text

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for the details. Here’s what’s likely happening and how to fix it:

---

### 1. **File List in Code**
The dashboard’s file dropdown is populated from a hardcoded list in `App.jsx`:
```js
const DATA_FILES = [
  'ADRIFT_All.csv',
  // Add more files as needed
];
```
**If you change your file names, you must update this list** to match your new filenames.  
For example, if your new file is `MyProject_MySpecies.csv`, update the array:
```js
const DATA_FILES = [
  'MyProject_MySpecies.csv',
  // Add more files as needed
];
```

---

### 2. **HTML Code in Place of Text**
If you see HTML code instead of the summary text, it’s likely because the `.txt` file is being served with an HTML error (like a 404 Not Found page) instead of the actual text file.  
This happens if the code tries to fetch a summary file that doesn’t exist at the expected path.

**Check:**
- The summary file should be named exactly as `{project}_{species}.txt` (matching the CSV filename, but with `.txt`).
- The file should be in `public/supplement/`.

**Example:**  
If your CSV is `MyProject_MySpecies.csv`, your summary file should be `MyProject_MySpecies.txt` in `public/supplement/`.

---

### 3. **How to Fix**
- Update the `DATA_FILES` array in `App.jsx` to match your new CSV filenames.
- Make sure the summary `.txt` files are named and placed correctly.
- Save your changes and refresh the page.

---

### 4. **Optional: Make File List Dynamic**
If you want the dashboard to automatically detect all CSV files in `public/data/` (instead of hardcoding), let me know! I can help you set up a dynamic file list using a small script or a manifest file.

---

**Let me know if you want help making the file list dynamic, or if you need further troubleshooting!**

```javascript
const DATA_FILES = [
  'ADRIFT_All.csv',
  // Add more files as needed
];
```

```javascript
const DATA_FILES = [
  'MyProject_MySpecies.csv',
  // Add more files as needed
];
```

---

**User**

please make the list dynamic

---

**Cursor**

To make the file list dynamic in a static Vite/React app, you can’t directly read the contents of the `public/data` directory from the browser (due to browser security and static hosting). However, you can achieve this with a simple workaround:

### **Solution: Use a Manifest File**
1. **Create a file called `data_manifest.json` in `public/data/`**  
   This file will list all your CSV files, for example:
   ```json
   [
     "MyProject_MySpecies.csv",
     "AnotherProject_AnotherSpecies.csv"
   ]
   ```
2. **Update your React code to fetch and use this manifest**  
   The dashboard will load the manifest and populate the dropdown automatically.

---

### I will:
- Create instructions for the manifest file.
- Update your `App.jsx` to fetch and use the manifest.

Let’s proceed!

```json
   [
     "MyProject_MySpecies.csv",
     "AnotherProject_AnotherSpecies.csv"
   ]
```

```json
[
  "MyProject_MySpecies.csv",
  "AnotherProject_AnotherSpecies.csv"
]

```

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...
- // Helper to fetch available CSV files from public/data (simulate for now)
- const DATA_FILES = [
-   // Replace with dynamic fetch if you deploy to a real server
-   'ADRIFT_All.csv',
-   // Add more files as needed
- ];
+ // Fetch available CSV files from manifest

  function App() {
-   const [csvFiles, setCsvFiles] = useState(DATA_FILES);
-   const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(DATA_FILES[0]);
+   const [csvFiles, setCsvFiles] = useState([]);
+   const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState('');
// ... existing code ...
+   // Fetch manifest on mount
+   useEffect(() => {
+     fetch('/data/data_manifest.json')
+       .then(res => res.json())
+       .then(files => {
+         setCsvFiles(files);
+         setSelectedFile(files[0] || '');
+       })
+       .catch(() => setCsvFiles([]));
+   }, []);
// ... existing code ...

```

Your dashboard is now set up to dynamically list all CSV files using a manifest file:

### What’s new:
- A `data_manifest.json` file in `public/data/` lists all your CSV files.
- The dashboard fetches this manifest and populates the dropdown automatically—no more hardcoding filenames!

---

### **What you should do:**
1. **Edit `public/data/data_manifest.json`**  
   List all your actual CSV filenames, for example:
   ```json
   [
     "MyProject_MySpecies.csv",
     "AnotherProject_AnotherSpecies.csv"
   ]
   ```
   (Replace with your real filenames.)

2. **Make sure your CSV and summary TXT files are in the correct folders**  
   - CSVs: `public/data/`
   - Summaries: `public/supplement/`

3. **Restart your dev server** (if needed) and refresh your browser.

---

Now, any time you add or remove a CSV, just update `data_manifest.json`—the dashboard will update automatically!

If you want to automate the manifest creation or need further help, let me know!

```json
   [
     "MyProject_MySpecies.csv",
     "AnotherProject_AnotherSpecies.csv"
   ]
```

```json
   [
     "MyProject_MySpecies.csv",
     "AnotherProject_AnotherSpecies.csv"
   ]
```

---

**User**

yes, i want to automate the manifest creation so that the user does not need to update

---

**Cursor**

Great idea! Automating the creation of `data_manifest.json` will make your dashboard much more user-friendly.

### How to Automate the Manifest Creation

Since static sites (like those built with Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages) can’t list files in a directory at runtime, you’ll need a **build-time script** that scans the `public/data/` folder and generates `data_manifest.json` automatically.

#### Here’s how to do it:

---

### 1. **Add a Node.js Script**

Create a file called `generate_manifest.js` in your project root (or in a `scripts/` folder):

```js
// generate_manifest.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, 'SurveySummaryDashDashboard', 'public', 'data');
const manifestPath = path.join(dataDir, 'data_manifest.json');

const files = fs.readdirSync(dataDir)
  .filter(file => file.endsWith('.csv'));

fs.writeFileSync(manifestPath, JSON.stringify(files, null, 2));
console.log(`Manifest generated with ${files.length} CSV files.`);
```

---

### 2. **Add a Script to package.json**

In your `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/package.json`, add:
```json
"scripts": {
  "generate-manifest": "node ../generate_manifest.js",
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```
*(Assuming you put `generate_manifest.js` in the parent directory. Adjust the path if you put it elsewhere.)*

---

### 3. **Run the Script**

Whenever you add or remove CSV files, run:
```sh
npm run generate-manifest
```
This will update `data_manifest.json` automatically.

---

### 4. **Automate on Build (Optional)**

You can also add this to your build process by updating the `build` script:
```json
"build": "npm run generate-manifest && vite build"
```

---

Would you like me to create the `generate_manifest.js` file for you? If so, let me know where you want it placed (project root or inside a `scripts/` folder).

```javascript
// generate_manifest.js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, 'SurveySummaryDashDashboard', 'public', 'data');
const manifestPath = path.join(dataDir, 'data_manifest.json');

const files = fs.readdirSync(dataDir)
  .filter(file => file.endsWith('.csv'));

fs.writeFileSync(manifestPath, JSON.stringify(files, null, 2));
console.log(`Manifest generated with ${files.length} CSV files.`);
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate-manifest": "node ../generate_manifest.js",
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

```shellscript
npm run generate-manifest
```

```json
"build": "npm run generate-manifest && vite build"
```

---

**User**

yes, create that and put in the scripts/ folder (this will need to be created).   

---

**Cursor**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'public', 'data');
const manifestPath = path.join(dataDir, 'data_manifest.json');

const files = fs.readdirSync(dataDir)
  .filter(file => file.endsWith('.csv'));

fs.writeFileSync(manifestPath, JSON.stringify(files, null, 2));
console.log(`Manifest generated with ${files.length} CSV files.`);

```

```json
// ... existing code ...
  "scripts": {
-    "dev": "vite",
-    "build": "vite build",
-    "lint": "eslint .",
-    "preview": "vite preview"
+    "dev": "vite",
+    "generate-manifest": "node ./scripts/generate_manifest.js",
+    "build": "npm run generate-manifest && vite build",
+    "lint": "eslint .",
+    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
// ... existing code ...
```

You now have an automated manifest generator:

1. **A script is in `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/scripts/generate_manifest.js`**  
   It scans `public/data/` for `.csv` files and writes `data_manifest.json`.

2. **Your `package.json` has new scripts:**
   - `npm run generate-manifest` — updates the manifest.
   - `npm run build` — will always update the manifest before building.

---

### **How to use:**
- Whenever you add or remove CSV files in `public/data/`, just run:
  ```sh
  npm run generate-manifest
  ```
- The dashboard will always have an up-to-date file list!

---

You’re now set up for a smooth, user-friendly workflow.  
If you want to automate this even further (e.g., on every `npm start`/`npm run dev`), let me know! Otherwise, you’re ready to go.

```shellscript
  npm run generate-manifest
```

---

**User**

yes, automate further

---

**Cursor**

```json
// ... existing code ...
-    "dev": "vite",
+    "dev": "npm run generate-manifest && vite",
// ... existing code ...
```

Now, every time you run the development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
```

the manifest will be automatically regenerated to reflect any changes in your `public/data/` folder.  
You no longer need to manually update the manifest—just add or remove CSV files and start your dev server as usual!

If you need any more automation or want to further streamline your workflow, let me know!

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

This error occurs because your project is set as an ES module (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`), but the script uses CommonJS (`require`). Node.js does not allow `require` in ES module scope.

**You have two easy options:**

---

### **Option 1: Rename the Script to `.cjs`**

1. **Rename** `generate_manifest.js` to `generate_manifest.cjs` in `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/scripts/`.
2. **Update your `package.json` scripts** to use the new filename:
   ```json
   "generate-manifest": "node ./scripts/generate_manifest.cjs",
   "dev": "npm run generate-manifest && vite",
   "build": "npm run generate-manifest && vite build"
   ```

---

### **Option 2: Convert the Script to ES Module Syntax**

Replace all `require`/`module.exports` with `import`/`export` syntax.  
For example:
```js
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
const __dirname = path.dirname(new URL(import.meta.url).pathname);
// ...rest of the code...
```
But **Option 1 is simpler and more robust for utility scripts**.

---

**Would you like me to apply Option 1 (rename to `.cjs`) for you?**  
This is the quickest fix and will work immediately.

```json
   "generate-manifest": "node ./scripts/generate_manifest.cjs",
   "dev": "npm run generate-manifest && vite",
   "build": "npm run generate-manifest && vite build"
```

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
const __dirname = path.dirname(new URL(import.meta.url).pathname);
// ...rest of the code...
```

---

**User**

yes

---

**Cursor**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const dataDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'public', 'data');
const manifestPath = path.join(dataDir, 'data_manifest.json');

const files = fs.readdirSync(dataDir)
  .filter(file => file.endsWith('.csv'));

fs.writeFileSync(manifestPath, JSON.stringify(files, null, 2));
console.log(`Manifest generated with ${files.length} CSV files.`);

```json
// ... existing code ...
-    "generate-manifest": "node ./scripts/generate_manifest.js",
+    "generate-manifest": "node ./scripts/generate_manifest.cjs",
// ... existing code ...
```

The manifest generator script has been renamed to `generate_manifest.cjs` for CommonJS compatibility, and your `package.json` scripts have been updated accordingly.

### You can now:
- Run the dev server as usual:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
- The manifest will be generated automatically, and you should no longer see the "require is not defined" error.

If you encounter any further issues or want to add more automation or features, just let me know!

```shellscript
  npm run dev
```

The markers on the map are not good. The markers should each be a small dot. Also, the map should automatically reframe to show the region with the data (dots). It is currently showing the other side of the world

---

**Cursor**

To address your requests:

1. **Markers as Small Dots:**  
   The current code uses `<Marker>` from `react-leaflet`, which renders default pin icons. For small dots, you should use `<CircleMarker>` with a small radius and custom color.

2. **Map Automatically Fits Data:**  
   Instead of setting a fixed center/zoom, use the `MapContainer`'s `bounds` prop to fit all points. You can compute bounds from your data and update the map accordingly.

---

I will:
- Replace `<Marker>` with `<CircleMarker>` for small dot markers.
- Compute bounds from your points and use the `bounds` prop on `MapContainer` to auto-fit the map.

Let’s update your code!

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...
-import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup } from 'react-leaflet';
+import { MapContainer, TileLayer, CircleMarker, Popup } from 'react-leaflet';
// ... existing code ...
-  // Map center (mean of points)
-  const mapCenter = points.length
-    ? [
-        points.reduce((sum, r) => sum + parseFloat(r[latCol]), 0) / points.length,
-        points.reduce((sum, r) => sum + parseFloat(r[lonCol]), 0) / points.length,
-      ]
-    : [0, 0];
+  // Map bounds (fit all points)
+  const mapBounds = points.length
+    ? points.map(row => [parseFloat(row[latCol]), parseFloat(row[lonCol])])
+    : [[0, 0]];
// ... existing code ...
-            <MapContainer center={mapCenter} zoom={points.length ? 7 : 2} style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%' }}>
-              <TileLayer url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" />
-              {points.map((row, i) => (
-                <Marker key={i} position={[parseFloat(row[latCol]), parseFloat(row[lonCol])]}>
-                  <Popup>
-                    {columns.map((col) => (
-                      <div key={col}><b>{col}:</b> {row[col]}</div>
-                    ))}
-                  </Popup>
-                </Marker>
-              ))}
-            </MapContainer>
+            <MapContainer bounds={mapBounds} style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%' }}>
+              <TileLayer url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" />
+              {points.map((row, i) => (
+                <CircleMarker
+                  key={i}
+                  center={[parseFloat(row[latCol]), parseFloat(row[lonCol])]}
+                  radius={4}
+                  pathOptions={{ color: '#1976d2', fillColor: '#1976d2', fillOpacity: 0.8 }}
+                >
+                  <Popup>
+                    {columns.map((col) => (
+                      <div key={col}><b>{col}:</b> {row[col]}</div>
+                    ))}
+                  </Popup>
+                </CircleMarker>
+              ))}
+            </MapContainer>
// ... existing code ...
```

Your map will now:
- Display each detection as a small blue dot (using `CircleMarker`).
- Automatically reframe to show all data points using the `bounds` prop.

**What to do next:**
1. Save your work and restart the dev server if needed:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Refresh your browser.

You should now see small dots for each detection, and the map should always fit the region containing your data.  
If you want to further customize marker color by species or add a legend, just let me know!

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

**User**

The map does not function correctly- it does not zoom in or out, and I cannot see the markers. Yes, I would like a legend when it is fixed

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for your feedback! Here’s how I’ll address your issues:

### 1. **Map Not Zooming or Showing Markers**
- The `bounds` prop on `MapContainer` only sets the initial view and does not update after the map is created. For dynamic fitting, you need to use the `useMap` hook and `fitBounds` method.
- If all points are the same or missing, the map may not zoom correctly.
- Let’s also ensure the map is only rendered if there are valid points.

### 2. **Add a Legend**
- I’ll add a color legend for species (or another column if you prefer).

---

I will:
- Use a custom component to fit bounds dynamically when points change.
- Assign a unique color to each species and show a legend.
- Ensure markers are visible and the map is interactive.

Let’s update your code!

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...

+    } else if (bounds && bounds.length === 1) {
+      map.setView(bounds[0], 10);
+    }
+  }, [bounds, map]);
+  return null;
+}

+              <Box sx={{ position: 'absolute', top: 8, right: 8, background: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.9)', borderRadius: 1, p: 1, boxShadow: 1 }}>
+                <Typography variant="caption" sx={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Species Legend</Typography>
+                {speciesList.map((sp, idx) => (
+                  <Box key={sp} sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 1 }}>
+                    <Box sx={{ width: 14, height: 14, borderRadius: '50%', background: getSpeciesColor(sp), border: '1px solid #888' }} />

+                ))}
+              </Box>
+            )}
+          </Box>
// ... existing code ...
```

Your map will now:
- Dynamically zoom and pan to fit all detection points, even as data changes.
- Show each detection as a small dot, colored by species.
- Display a legend in the map corner when multiple species are present.

**What to do next:**
1. Save your work and restart the dev server if needed:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Refresh your browser.

You should now see a properly zooming map, colored dots for each species, and a legend.  
If you want to further customize the legend or marker appearance, or color by another column, just let me know!

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

**User**

great. The legend appears behind the map I think. Can you make the legend show up next to the map but not in front or behind the map?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! To ensure the legend does not overlap or appear behind the map, the best approach is to place the legend outside the map container, but visually adjacent to it.

**Here’s what I’ll do:**
- Move the legend outside the absolutely-positioned map area.
- Place the legend in a vertical flexbox next to the map, so it always appears to the right of the map (not overlapping).

This will make the layout:
- Left: summary text
- Center: map
- Right: legend (if multiple species)

Let’s update your code for a clean, non-overlapping legend!

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...

The legend is now placed in a flex row next to the map, ensuring it does not overlap or appear behind the map. It will always appear to the right of the map, clearly visible and accessible.

**What to do next:**
1. Save your work and restart the dev server if needed:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Refresh your browser.

You should now see the legend neatly to the right of the map, not overlapping or hidden.  
If you want further layout tweaks or additional legend features, just let me know!

**User**

Great. I would not like to implement this for showing in github pages

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Deploying your Vite/React dashboard to GitHub Pages is straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

## 1. **Install the GitHub Pages Deployment Package**

In your `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` directory, run:
```sh
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

---

## 2. **Update `vite.config.js` for GitHub Pages**

You need to set the `base` path in your Vite config to match your repository name.  
If you don’t have a `vite.config.js` yet, let me know and I’ll create one for you.

**Example for a repo named `SurveySummaryDash`:**
```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/SurveySummaryDash/', // <-- your repo name here, with slashes
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

---

## 3. **Add Deployment Scripts to `package.json`**

Add these scripts:
```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```
Your scripts section should now include `"deploy"` and `"predeploy"`.

---

## 4. **Build and Deploy**

Run:
```sh
npm run deploy
```
This will build your app and push the contents of the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo.

---

## 5. **Access Your Dashboard**

After a few minutes, your dashboard will be available at:
```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/
```
For example:  
`https://Shannon.github.io/SurveySummaryDash/`

---

### Would you like me to:
- Create or update your `vite.config.js` for you?
- Update your `package.json` scripts?
- Or do you want to try these steps yourself and ask if you get stuck?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

```shellscript
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

```javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/SurveySummaryDash/', // <-- your repo name here, with slashes
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

```shellscript
npm run deploy
```

```plaintext
https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/
```

---

**User**

please do these actions

---

**Cursor**

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/SurveySummaryDash/',
  plugins: [react()],
});

```

```json
// ... existing code ...
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
// ... existing code ...
```

All deployment steps are now set up:

1. **Vite config** is set for GitHub Pages (`base: '/SurveySummaryDash/'`).
2. **Deployment scripts** (`predeploy` and `deploy`) are added to your `package.json`.
3. **gh-pages** package is installed.

---

### To deploy your dashboard to GitHub Pages, simply run:
```sh
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build your app
- Generate the manifest
- Publish the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository

After a few minutes, your dashboard will be live at:
```
https://<your-username>.github.io/SurveySummaryDash/
```

If you encounter any issues or want to customize the deployment further, let me know!

```shellscript

**User**

The SurveySummaryDashDashboard is within the SurveySummaryDash project, and when I pushed all changes to github, it messed things up. Can you troubleshoot?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here’s what’s likely happening and how to fix it:

---

## **What Happened?**
- Your Vite project (`SurveySummaryDashDashboard`) is a subfolder inside your main repo (`SurveySummaryDash`).
- When you run `npm run deploy` from within `SurveySummaryDashDashboard`, the `gh-pages` package creates a `gh-pages` branch and pushes the built site from the `dist` folder.
- If your repo root is not the Vite project, the deployment may not work as expected, and your repo structure may become confusing.

---

## **Best Practice for GitHub Pages with Vite**
- The **Vite project should be at the root** of the repository if you want the repo to be just the dashboard.
- If you want to keep other files/folders (like data, docs, etc.) in the root, you can:
  - Keep the dashboard in a subfolder, but you must set the correct `base` and run deploy from the dashboard folder.
  - Or, create a separate repo just for the dashboard.

---

## **How to Fix**

### **Option 1: Keep Dashboard in a Subfolder (Recommended for Your Case)**
1. **Make sure you are always running `npm run deploy` from inside the `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` folder.**
2. The `base` in `vite.config.js` should match the repo name, not the subfolder:
   ```js
   base: '/SurveySummaryDash/'
   ```
3. The deployment will still work, but your repo will have the dashboard in a subfolder and the built site on the `gh-pages` branch.

### **Option 2: Move Dashboard to Repo Root (If You Want the Repo to Be Just the Dashboard)**
- Move all files from `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` to the root of `SurveySummaryDash`.
- Update all paths accordingly.
- Run `npm run deploy` from the root.

### **Option 3: Separate Repos**
- Create a new repo just for the dashboard.
- Move the Vite project there and deploy from that repo.

---

## **Troubleshooting Steps**

1. **Check your repo structure on GitHub.**
   - Is the `gh-pages` branch present?
   - Is the `dist` folder being built and pushed?
2. **Check your GitHub Pages settings.**
   - Is it set to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch?
3. **Check the URL.**
   - Is it using the correct path (`/SurveySummaryDash/`)?

---

## **What Should I Do Next?**
- Would you like to keep the dashboard in a subfolder, or move it to the root?
- Do you want step-by-step instructions for either option?
- If you want to keep the current structure, I can help you clean up the repo and ensure deployment works.

**Let me know your preference, and I’ll guide you through the fix!**

```javascript
   base: '/SurveySummaryDash/'
```

**User**

Can you (1) create the SurveySummaryDashDashboard as its own repository and (2) create instructions for how to later implement it within a different repository? Then, I can improve the primary repository and eventually in the future I can add it to other projects/repositories. 

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here’s a clear plan for both steps:

---

## 1. **Create `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` as Its Own Repository**

### **A. Steps to Create a New GitHub Repo**
1. **On GitHub:**  
   - Go to your GitHub account.
   - Click “New repository”.
   - Name it `SurveySummaryDashDashboard`.
   - (Optional) Add a description, set to public or private.
   - Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since you already have files locally).

2. **On Your Computer:**  
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` folder:
     ```sh
     cd path/to/SurveySummaryDashDashboard
     ```
   - Initialize a new git repo (if not already):
     ```sh
     git init
     ```
   - Add your new GitHub repo as the remote:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/SurveySummaryDashDashboard.git
     ```
   - Add all files, commit, and push:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit: standalone dashboard"
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**  
   - From inside the `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` folder, run:
     ```sh
     npm run deploy
     ```
   - Set GitHub Pages to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch (if not automatic).

---

## 2. **Instructions: How to Integrate the Dashboard into Another Repository in the Future**

### **A. As a Submodule (Recommended for Reuse)**
1. **In your target repo,** add the dashboard as a submodule:
   ```sh
   git submodule add https://github.com/<your-username>/SurveySummaryDashDashboard.git
   ```
   This will create a folder with the dashboard code, which you can update independently.

2. **To update the dashboard in the future:**
   ```sh
   cd SurveySummaryDashDashboard
   git pull origin main
   cd ..
   git add SurveySummaryDashDashboard
   git commit -m "Update dashboard submodule"
   git push
   ```

### **B. As a Copied Folder**
- Simply copy the entire `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` folder into your new repo.
- Update the `base` in `vite.config.js` to match the new repo name if you want to deploy from there.

### **C. As a Standalone Deployment**
- You can always keep the dashboard as a separate site and just link to it from your main project’s README or documentation.

   git add SurveySummaryDashDashboard
   git commit -m "Update dashboard submodule"
   git push
```

**User**

Instead of creating a NEW repository, can you instead use the SurveySummaryDash as the 'new' repository, and renew as needed? If this complicates things, then I will create a new repo (with a new name)

---

**Cursor**

You can absolutely use your existing SurveySummaryDash repository as the home for your dashboard, as long as you’re comfortable with the dashboard being the main focus of the repo (i.e., the Vite project is at the root). This is the simplest and most robust setup for GitHub Pages deployment and future maintenance.

---

## **How to “Renew” SurveySummaryDash as a Dashboard Repo**

### **1. Move Dashboard to Repo Root**
- Move all files and folders from `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/` up to the root of `SurveySummaryDash/`.
- Overwrite or merge as needed (be careful with files like `README.md`, `package.json`, etc.).
- Remove the now-empty `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/` folder.

### **2. Clean Up Old Files**
- Remove or archive any files/folders that are not part of the dashboard (unless you want to keep them for documentation or data).

### **3. Update Vite Config**
- In `vite.config.js`, set:
  ```js
  base: '/SurveySummaryDash/'
  ```
  (This is already set if you followed previous steps.)

### **4. Update GitHub Pages Settings**
- Make sure GitHub Pages is set to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.

### **5. Commit and Push**
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Restructure: dashboard is now at repo root"
git push
```

### **6. Deploy**
```sh
npm run deploy
```

---

## **Future: Using This Dashboard in Other Projects**
- You can copy the entire repo to a new one and update the `base` in `vite.config.js` to match the new repo name.
- Or, you can add it as a submodule or subtree in another repo if you want to keep it in sync.

---

**User**

There are package.json and package-lock.json in BOTH the root directory and teh SurveySummaryDashDashboard folder. Can you merge these (or replace the appropriate one)?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Here’s the best approach for your scenario:

---

## **Goal:**  
You want the **dashboard to be at the root** of your SurveySummaryDash repo, with a single, clean `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

---

## **Recommended Steps**

### 1. **Back Up Your Work**
- Before making changes, consider copying your repo to a backup folder, just in case.

### 2. **Choose the Correct `package.json`**
- The one in `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` is the correct one for your Vite/React dashboard.
- The root `package.json` is likely older or for a different setup.

### 3. **Replace Root Files**
- Move (or copy and overwrite) `package.json` and `package-lock.json` from `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/` to the root of your repo (`SurveySummaryDash/`).
- If you have custom scripts or dependencies in the root `package.json` that are not in the dashboard’s, you can manually merge them, but for most dashboard projects, you can just overwrite.

### 4. **Remove the Old Folder**
- Once you’ve moved everything, you can delete the now-empty `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/` folder.

### 5. **Reinstall Node Modules**
- In the root of your repo, run:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### 6. **Test the Dashboard**
- Run:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
- Make sure everything works as expected.

---

## **Terminal Commands (from the root of your repo):**
```sh
# Move package files to root (overwrite if prompted)
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/package.json .
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/package-lock.json .

# (Optional) Move all dashboard source files to root
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/* .
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/.* . 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove the now-empty folder
rmdir SurveySummaryDashDashboard

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Test the dev server
npm run dev
```

---

## **Summary**
- Use the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` from the dashboard folder.
- Overwrite the root versions.
- Reinstall dependencies and test.

---

If you want, I can generate a merged `package.json` if you have custom scripts in both, but for most cases, just using the dashboard’s is best.

**Let me know if you want to proceed with these steps or need help with a custom merge!**

```shellscript
  npm install
```

```shellscript
  npm run dev
```

```shellscript
# Move package files to root (overwrite if prompted)
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/package.json .
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/package-lock.json .

# (Optional) Move all dashboard source files to root
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/* .
mv SurveySummaryDashDashboard/.* . 2>/dev/null || true

# Remove the now-empty folder
rmdir SurveySummaryDashDashboard

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Test the dev server
npm run dev
```

---

**User**

yes please do a custom merge

---

**Cursor**

Here’s a custom merge plan for your `package.json`:

---

### **Merged `package.json`**

- **Keep all dashboard scripts and add any missing dependencies from the root.**
- **Combine all dependencies and devDependencies.**
- **Preserve dashboard-specific fields (`name`, `private`, `type`, etc.).**

---

#### **Merged Example:**

```json
{
  "name": "surveysummarydash",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run generate-manifest && vite",
    "generate-manifest": "node ./scripts/generate_manifest.cjs",
    "build": "npm run generate-manifest && vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
  },
  "dependencies": {

    "globals": "^16.3.0",
    "vite": "^7.0.4"
  }
}
```

---

**Next steps:**
- I will update your root `package.json` with this merged content.
- Afterward, delete the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` from the `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` folder.
- Run `npm install` in the root to ensure all dependencies are installed.

Let’s update your root `package.json` now!

    "vite": "^7.0.4"
  }
}

```

Your root `package.json` is now fully merged, containing all scripts and dependencies from both the dashboard and the original root.

### Next Steps:
1. **Delete** `package.json` and `package-lock.json` from the `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` folder (to avoid confusion).
2. **Move all dashboard source files** (if not already done) from `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/` to the root of your repo.
3. **Reinstall dependencies** in the root:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Test the dev server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Test deployment:**
   ```sh
   npm run deploy
   ```

**User**

There is also a folder called node_modules in the root directory, and in the SurveySummaryDashDashboard folder. How should I proceed?

---

**Cursor**

Great question! Here’s what to do:

---

## **How to Handle `node_modules` Folders**

- **You only need one `node_modules` folder** in your project root (where your merged `package.json` is).
- The `node_modules` folder inside `SurveySummaryDashDashboard` is now obsolete and can be safely deleted.

---

### **Steps:**

1. **Delete the old dashboard’s `node_modules` folder:**
   - You can do this from the command line:
     ```sh
     rm -rf SurveySummaryDashDashboard/node_modules
     ```
   - Or, delete it manually in your file explorer.

2. **Keep the `node_modules` folder in your root directory.**
   - This is where all dependencies will be installed and used from now on.

3. **(Optional) Clean up any other duplicate or obsolete files in `SurveySummaryDashDashboard/` if you haven’t already.**

---

### **Summary**
- Only keep `node_modules` in the root.
- Delete `node_modules` from `SurveySummaryDashDashboard`.

---

After this, you’re all set!  
If you want, you can also run:
```sh
npm install
```
in the root to ensure everything is up to date.

Let me know if you need help with any other cleanup or setup!

```shellscript
     rm -rf SurveySummaryDashDashboard/node_modules
```

```shellscript
npm install
```

---

**User**

I ran   npm run dev and I did not get any errors, but it did not provide a link to the local host

---

**Cursor**

If `npm run dev` runs without errors but does not show a link (like `http://localhost:5173/`), here are some things to check and try:

---

### 1. **Check the Terminal Output**
- Sometimes the link is hidden in the output or appears after a few seconds.
- Look for lines like:
  ```
  VITE vX.X.X  ready in XXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ```

---

### 2. **Try Opening the Default Vite URL**
- By default, Vite serves at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
- Open your browser and go to:  
  [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

---

### 3. **Check for a Custom Port**
- If you have a `vite.config.js` with a custom port, the URL may be different.
- Open `vite.config.js` and look for a `server` section:
  ```js
  server: {
    port: 3000
  }
  ```
  If so, use that port (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/`).

---

### 4. **Check for Running Server**
- Make sure the terminal is not waiting for input and that the server is running (not exited).
- If the server exited, try running:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
  again and watch for errors.

---

### 5. **Try Accessing from Another Device**
- If you want to access from another device on your network, use your computer’s IP address and the port (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:5173/`).

---

### 6. **If Still No Output**
- Please copy and paste the full terminal output here so I can help diagnose further.

---

Let me know what you see or if you want to share the terminal output for more help!

```plaintext
  VITE vX.X.X  ready in XXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

```javascript
  server: {
    port: 3000
  }
```

```shellscript
  npm run dev
```

---

**User**

vite.config.js is not in the folder. Could this have been in the node_modules folder that I just deleted from the SurveySummaryDashDashboard folder?

---

**Cursor**

No, your `vite.config.js` should **never** be in the `node_modules` folder. It should always be in the root of your project (the same place as your `package.json`). The `node_modules` folder only contains installed packages, not your project’s configuration files.

If `vite.config.js` is missing, Vite will use its default settings, which usually works, but you need this file for custom settings (like the `base` for GitHub Pages).

---

## **What to Do**

1. **Check if `vite.config.js` is in your trash/recycle bin** (if you deleted it by accident).
2. **If it’s missing, I can recreate it for you.**

---

### **Here’s a standard `vite.config.js` for your project:**

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/SurveySummaryDash/',
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

---

**Would you like me to recreate this file in your project root?**  
If yes, I’ll add it for you so you can continue with local development and deployment!

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/SurveySummaryDash/',
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

---

**User**

yes please create it 

---

**Cursor**

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  base: '/SurveySummaryDash/',
  plugins: [react()],
});

```

Your `vite.config.js` has been recreated in the project root with the correct settings for GitHub Pages deployment.

You can now run:
```sh
npm run dev
```
and open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

If you need to deploy, just run:
```sh
npm run deploy
```

Let me know if you encounter any further issues or need help with the next steps!

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

```shellscript
npm run deploy
```

---

**User**

it is still not available. Can you help me troubleshoot?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Let’s troubleshoot step by step:

---

## 1. **Check Terminal Output**
- After running `npm run dev`, do you see any output at all?  
  (e.g., “VITE vX.X.X ready in XXX ms”, or any errors/warnings?)
- Please copy and paste the full output here.

---

## 2. **Check for Running Server**
- Is your terminal prompt waiting for input, or is it “stuck” (which is good, means the server is running)?
- If the server is running, try opening [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

---

## 3. **Check for Port Conflicts**
- If another app is using port 5173, Vite may switch to another port (e.g., 5174).
- Look for a line like:
  ```
  Local: http://localhost:5174/
  ```
- Try opening that URL in your browser.

---

## 4. **Check for Firewall/Antivirus Issues**
- Sometimes, security software can block local servers. Try temporarily disabling it or checking its logs.

---

## 5. **Try a Clean Install**
- Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` in your project root.
- Run:
  ```sh
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

---

## 6. **Check for Browser Issues**
- Try a different browser or incognito/private mode.
- Clear your browser cache.

---

## 7. **Check Vite Version**
- Run:
  ```sh
  npx vite --version
  ```
- You should see a version number (e.g., 7.x.x).

---

## 8. **If Nothing Works**
- Please copy and paste the full output of `npm run dev` here.
- Let me know your OS and Node.js version (run `node -v`).

---

**Let’s start with step 1: What is the full output when you run `npm run dev`?**

```plaintext
  Local: http://localhost:5174/
```

```shellscript
  npm install
  npm run dev

1. Check terminal Output: no output (no errors, but not output)

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for the update. If running `npm run dev` gives you absolutely no output (not even an error), this is unusual and suggests one of the following:

- The script is not being executed at all.
- There is a problem with your Node.js/npm installation.
- There is a misconfiguration in your `package.json`.
- The terminal is not running in the correct directory.

Let’s systematically troubleshoot:

---

### 1. **Check You Are in the Correct Directory**
Make sure you are in the root directory of your project (where `package.json` is located).  
Run:
```sh
ls
```
You should see `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, and your source folders.

---

### 2. **Check the `dev` Script in `package.json`**
Open `package.json` and look for:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "npm run generate-manifest && vite",
  ...
}
```
If it’s missing or different, let me know.

---

### 3. **Try Running Vite Directly**
Try running:
```sh
npx vite
```
If you see output and a local server link, the problem is with the npm script. If you still see nothing, the problem is with Node/npm or Vite.

---

### 4. **Check Node and NPM Versions**
Run:
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```
Share the output here.

---

### 5. **Try a Clean Install**
Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run:
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### 6. **Try a Simple Script**
Add a test script to your `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "test-echo": "echo Hello World"
}
```
Then run:
```sh
npm run test-echo
```
If you see “Hello World”, npm is working. If not, there’s a deeper issue.

---

**Please try these steps and let me know:**
- The result of `ls`
- The contents of your `package.json` scripts section
- The result of `npx vite`
- Your Node and npm versions
- The result of the test script

This will help pinpoint the issue quickly!

```shellscript
ls
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "npm run generate-manifest && vite",
  ...
}
```

```shellscript
npx vite
```

```shellscript
node -v
npm -v
```

```shellscript
npm install
npm run dev
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "test-echo": "echo Hello World"
}
```

```shellscript
npm run test-echo
```

Great! Now I can see the issue. The server is actually running (you can see the Vite output), but there's a Babel/React plugin error that's preventing the app from loading properly.

The error `_lruCache is not a constructor` is typically caused by version conflicts between Babel packages. This is a common issue when dependencies get mixed up.

Here's how to fix it:

---

## **Solution: Clean Install with Force**

1. **Delete the current `node_modules` and lock file:**
   ```sh
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. **Clear npm cache:**
   ```sh
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Try running the dev server again:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## **If That Doesn't Work, Try This Alternative:**

1. **Update to the latest versions of React and Vite:**
   ```sh
   npm install react@latest react-dom@latest @vitejs/plugin-react@latest vite@latest
   ```

2. **Then run:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## **What Should Happen:**
- The server should start without the Babel error
- You should see: `Local: http://localhost:5173/SurveySummaryDash/`
- The app should load in your browser

---

**Try the clean install first, and let me know if you still get the error!**

```shellscript
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

```shellscript
   npm cache clean --force
```

```shellscript
   npm install
```

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

```shellscript
   npm install react@latest react-dom@latest @vitejs/plugin-react@latest vite@latest
```

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```

Ah, you're using PowerShell on Windows! The `rm -rf` command is for Unix/Linux. Here are the correct PowerShell commands:

---

## **PowerShell Commands for Windows:**

1. **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json:**
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
   Remove-Item package-lock.json
   ```

2. **Clear npm cache:**
   ```powershell
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the dev server:**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## **Alternative (shorter PowerShell syntax):**
```powershell
rd /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

**Try these PowerShell commands and let me know if the Babel error is resolved!**

```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
   Remove-Item package-lock.json
```

```powershell
   npm cache clean --force
```

```powershell
   npm install
```

```powershell
   npm run dev
```

```powershell
rd /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run dev
```

You're in the wrong directory! You need to be in your project directory first.

---

## **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Shannon\Documents\GitHub\SurveySummaryDash"
```

Then run the cleanup commands:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run dev
```

## **Or Do It All in One Go:**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Shannon\Documents\GitHub\SurveySummaryDash"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

**Make sure you're in the SurveySummaryDash directory (where your `package.json` file is located) before running the commands!**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Shannon\Documents\GitHub\SurveySummaryDash"
```

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json

Ok, now the dashboard can be viewed, but the summary text, map, and user selections are no longer available

---

**Cursor**

Great progress! If the dashboard loads but the summary text, map, and user selections are missing, here are the most likely causes and how to fix them:

---

## 1. **Check File Locations**
- Make sure your data files are in the correct locations:
  - CSV files: `public/data/`
  - Summary text files: `public/supplement/`
- These folders should be in your project root (where `package.json` is), not in a subfolder.

---

## 2. **Check Manifest**
- Make sure `public/data/data_manifest.json` exists and lists your CSV files.
- If you add/remove CSVs, run:
  ```sh
  npm run generate-manifest
  ```

---

## 3. **Check for Console Errors**
- Open your browser’s developer console (F12) and look for errors about missing files or failed fetches.
- Common errors:
  - 404 for `/data/yourfile.csv` or `/supplement/yourfile.txt`
  - CORS errors (shouldn’t happen locally)

---

## 4. **Check Code for Path References**
- In your code, CSVs are loaded from `/data/filename.csv` and summaries from `/supplement/filename.txt`.
- If you moved files, update the manifest and ensure the code points to the right paths.

---

## 5. **Check for Data in the CSV**
- If your CSV is empty or missing required columns (like latitude/longitude), the map and selections may not appear.

---

## 6. **Restart the Dev Server**
- After moving files or updating the manifest, always restart the dev server:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

---

## **Checklist:**
- [ ] Are your CSV and TXT files in `public/data/` and `public/supplement/`?
- [ ] Does `public/data/data_manifest.json` list your CSV files?
- [ ] Do you see any errors in the browser console?
- [ ] Is your CSV file non-empty and has the expected columns?

---

**If you’re still stuck:**
- Please share the structure of your `public/` folder (list of files/folders).
- Copy any errors from the browser console here.
- Let me know the name of your CSV and summary TXT files.

I’ll help you get the summary, map, and selections working again!

```shellscript
  npm run generate-manifest
```

```shellscript
  npm run dev
```

**User**

The files are in the public/data and public/supplement folders and there are no errors in the browser console. The identification of the files in the public/data and public/supplement folders was automatically identified using a script (manifest), as these will change. For now, the files are public/data/ADRIFT01_All.csv and public/data/ADRIFT01_All.txt

---

**Cursor**

Thank you for the details! Here’s what could be happening and how to fix it:

---

## 1. **Manifest File Content**
- Your manifest file should be at `public/data/data_manifest.json`.
- It should contain:
  ```json
  [
    "ADRIFT01_All.csv"
  ]
  ```
- If the manifest lists the correct CSV, the dropdown should show it.

---

## 2. **Summary Text File Name**
- The code expects the summary text file to be in `public/supplement/` and named exactly like the CSV, but with `.txt`:
  - For `ADRIFT01_All.csv`, it should be `public/supplement/ADRIFT01_All.txt`.

---

## 3. **Code Logic for Loading Summary**
- The code splits the filename on `_` and expects the format `project_species.csv`:
  ```js
  const [project, species] = selectedFile.replace('.csv', '').split('_');
  fetch(`/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`)
  ```
- For `ADRIFT01_All.csv`, this becomes:
  - `project = "ADRIFT01"`
  - `species = "All"`
  - So it fetches `/supplement/ADRIFT01_All.txt`

**If your file is named `ADRIFT01_All.txt` in `public/supplement/`, this should work.**

---

## 4. **Map and User Selections**
- The map and dropdowns depend on the CSV having columns like `lat`, `lon`, `species`, `calltype`, etc.
- If your CSV uses different column names, the code won’t find them and nothing will display.

---

## 5. **What to Check Next**
- Open your CSV and confirm it has columns named (case-insensitive):  
  - `lat` or `latitude`
  - `lon` or `longitude`
  - `species`
  - `calltype`
- If your columns are named differently, let me know the exact column names and I’ll update the code to match.

---

## 6. **Debug Output**
- Add a `console.log(columns, csvData)` in your code after parsing the CSV to see what columns are detected.

---

## **Summary Checklist**
- [x] Manifest lists `ADRIFT01_All.csv`
- [x] `public/supplement/ADRIFT01_All.txt` exists
- [x] CSV has required columns (`lat`, `lon`, etc.)
- [x] No browser console errors

---

**If you’re still not seeing the summary, map, or selections:**
- Please paste the first few lines (header + 2 rows) of your CSV here.
- List the exact filenames in `public/data/` and `public/supplement/`.

I’ll help you adjust the code to match your data!

```json
  [
    "ADRIFT01_All.csv"
  ]
```

```javascript
  const [project, species] = selectedFile.replace('.csv', '').split('_');
  fetch(`/supplement/${project}_${species}.txt`)
```

Thank you for sharing your CSV header and sample data!  
Your columns are:
- `UTC`, `lat`, `lon`, `species`, `caltype`, `end`, `site`, `siteGroup`, `gpsUncertainty`

**This matches what the dashboard expects for:**
- Latitude: `lat`
- Longitude: `lon`
- Species: `species`
- Call type: `caltype` (note: the code looks for `calltype`)

---

## **What Needs Fixing**

### 1. **Call Type Column**
- Your column is named `caltype` but the code looks for `calltype`.
- **Solution:** Update the code to also check for `caltype` if `calltype` is not found.

### 2. **Everything Else Looks Good**
- The other columns (`lat`, `lon`, `species`) match what the code expects.

---

## **Code Update Needed**

I will update the code to support both `calltype` and `caltype` as the call type column.

---

**After this change, your dashboard should show the map, summary, and user selections!**

```javascriptreact
// ... existing code ...
-  const speciesCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('species'));
-  const callTypeCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('calltype'));
+  const speciesCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('species'));
+  let callTypeCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('calltype'));
+  if (!callTypeCol) {
+    callTypeCol = columns.find((c) => c.toLowerCase().includes('caltype'));
+  }
// ... existing code ...
```

The code now supports both `calltype` and `caltype` as the call type column, so your data should work as expected.

**What to do next:**
1. Save your changes and restart the dev server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Refresh your browser.

You should now see the summary text, map, and user selections for your data.  
If anything is still missing, let me know and I’ll help you troubleshoot further!

```shellscript
   npm run dev
```
