SurveySummaryDash contains data to identify acoustic detections of animal and manmade sounds from recordings. Each call detection is attributed to a specific species (and for some species, the call type is identified), and it has a start and end time.

SurveySummaryDash is my local github repository and it contains the following folders:
- content:  content (pages) for github pages
- data: raw data
- _code: all code
- output: code output (quantitative data products that are not visualizations)
- figs: all figures, graphics, visualizations (from code or other source)
- docs: contains rendered versions of this repository

The raw data in the data folder will include csv files with the first word as the SurveyName and the data will include the following data columns:
UTC: start of call detection time in UTC date and time in this format 2021-08-22 14:17:35 where seconds are in decimal seconds
Latitude: latitude in decimal degrees
Longitude: longitude in decimal degrees
species: code to identify species
call: call type made by species or unidentified if not specified or NA if no sound was detected
end: end of of call detection time in UTC date and time in this format 2021-08-22 14:17:35 where seconds are in decimal seconds
site: recorder site or station
siteGroup: grouped recorders by geographic region

I need to develop an interactive dashboard (in R or python) for this repository to be accessed in github pages. Use color blind friendly palette.

The interactive choices will include:
- Choice of UTC or Local (default is local Pacific Time)
- Choose start and end of data to show with default to show all data
- Choice of site and siteGroup (select all that apply by checkbox)
- Choice of species and call (select all that apply by checkbox)
- Map Layer Choice including topography/bathymetry, satellite imagery, land cover/land use, 
- Environmental Data overlay will include options for temperature, precipitation, , Tide, lunar illumination and wind speed
- Comparison- allow user to compare by species, call, site, or siteGroup (select all that apply by checkbox). If the user selects a comparison, then the dashboard will be replicated for each of these selections independently. 

The dashboard will provide:
Top Row: Summary information on left, Spectrogram on Right
- Summary at top will include selected choices and the sum of the detections for each species and call for this selection, and the total effort (from the start of the first detection to the end of the final detection). If a Comparison is selected, then all parts of the dashboard will be repeated, starting with the summary for that comparison, and followed by the visualizations for each selected group in the comparison. For each species identified, a small image of the species will be added next to the name (images found in figs folder and labeled using the species name). If no image is available, add the 'noImage.jpg' from the figs folder.
- To right of summary, add a color spectrogram of a sample call for this species. The spectrogram can be made from a sample call found in the data/wav folder, saved by the species_call name. The spectrogram will allow the user to play the sound and a scrolling bar will move along the spectrogram as the sound is played. If there is no sample call found in teh data/wav folder, then present the noAudio.jpg (found in the figs folder) in place of the spectrogram.
Second Row: Distribution Map and Detection BoxPlots
- Distribution Map of detection locations where detections are colored by species and call are shown as 'texture' (solid, dotted, striped, etc). The map is sized to show all selected calls with a reasonable buffer so that detections are not at the edges. The map will include topography/bathymetry as default, but users can select environmental data overlays. 
- plotDetectionBoxplot in pamscapes package on cran for each selected species and call type

Third Row: Polar Detections and Diel Detections for Lunar/Tidal data
- plotPolarDetections in pamscapes package on cran for each selected species and call type
- Diel plot showing detection data overlaid on either Lunar or Tidal data
- Plot overlay of detection data with selected environmental data
